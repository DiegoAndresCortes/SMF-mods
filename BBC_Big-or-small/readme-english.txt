[color=blue][b]Summary:[/b][/color]
This BBCode makes it easier to change size of chosen text. Instead of using [nobbc][size=X]text[/size] you can now use either [big] or [small] to get separate sizes. These tags show up before the rest on the post page, and have two separate buttons.

[color=blue][b]Compatibility:[/b][/color]
Compatible with SMF 2.0 only

[color=blue][b]Installation Information:[/b][/color]
