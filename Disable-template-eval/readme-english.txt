[color=blue][b]Summary:[/b][/color]
In a number of cases, in support topics with an error concerning 'template eval()', the first answer from the Support Team will be to disable this.

This mod provides an easy tick-box configuration option for this in Server Settings / General (2.0), and Server Settings / Feature Configuration (1.1) - please see the screenshots attached.

Note also for bigger board users: if you're using a cache such as XCache, disabling template eval() will give you a performance boost.

[color=blue][b]Compatibility:[/b][/color]
Compatible with SMF 1.1 & 2.0 upto RC1 (Standard Feature in 2.0 RC2 onward)

[color=blue][b]Installation Information:[/b][/color]
The Package Manager should work in most cases, if you have problems installing please use the discussion thread as well as [url=http://docs.simplemachines.org/index.php?topic=402]Manual Installation of Mods[/url]
