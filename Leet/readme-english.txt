[color=blue][b]Summary:[/b][/color]
The popular 'Leet' Easter Egg was removed from SMF 2.x, for when a user reaches 1337 posts.  This mod restores it back for SMF 2.x.

By the same token
If your using SMF 1.1.x, and don't like the Easter Egg, use this mod to REMOVE the easter egg.

So just clarify
SMF 2.x = Restores it
SMF 1.1.x = Removes it

[color=blue][b]Compatibility:[/b][/color]
Compatible with SMF 2.0 and 1.1

[color=blue][b]Installation Information:[/b][/color]
