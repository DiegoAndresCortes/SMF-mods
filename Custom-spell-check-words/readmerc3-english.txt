[color=blue][b]Summary:[/b][/color]
This mod will allow you to add custom words to the spell check.

For example, lets say you have "JayBachatero".  If you use spell check it will mark it as a mis-spelled word.  So what this mod does is allow you to add "JayBachatero" to the list it will show "JayBachatero" as being spelled correctly.

The list of custom words is available in the admin panel and is entered as a comma seperated names.

[color=blue][b]Compatibility:[/b][/color]
Compatible with SMF 1.1 2.0RC3 (Comma separated list with text box entry in the admin panel)
